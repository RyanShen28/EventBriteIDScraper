One day, his daughter Lakm\u00e9 and her servant Mallika gather flowers. They are unaware that two British soldiers, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric and G\u00e9rald, are also nearby, accompanied by G\u00e9rald\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, her cousin, and their governess. When the rest of the party wanders away, leaving Gerald alone, Lakm\u00e9 encounters him. Despite her initial fear, they experience an undeniable attraction. This is unwelcome news to Lakm\u00e9\u2019s father, Nilakantha, who is incensed at the British officer\u2019s encroachment on his daughter\u2019s affections as well as his native land.\nDetermined to know the trespasser\u2019s identity, Nilakantha forces Lakm\u00e9 to sing at a busy market. Upon seeing G\u00e9rald, Lakm\u00e9 faints and Nilakantha stabs him, sure that he has violated his daughter\u2019s purity. Lakm\u00e9 is able to escape with G\u00e9rald to the forest, where they fall deeper in love as she helps him recover. In this romantic setting, there is a sacred spring that, legend has it, ensures the true and enduring love of those who drink its water. As Lakm\u00e9 draws water from the spring, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric arrives and implores G\u00e9rald to abandon Lakm\u00e9 and return to his military duties, setting the stage for the opera\u2019s concluding conflicts between the familiar and the foreign, and between loyalty and love.\nBased on popular fiction of the time, Lakm\u00e9 was a vehicle for soprano Marie van Zandt, an American-born diva whose voice and personal exploits captured the public\u2019s attention and contributed to the opera\u2019s success. Today, the opera is best known for its famous Flower Duet (\"Sous le d\u00f4me \u00e9pais\") and Bell Song (\u201cO\u00f9 va la jeune Hindoue?\u201d). Librettist Edmond Gondinet first conceived the opera and then involved his friend, composer Leo Delibes; it is therefore somewhat ironic that the story\u2019s content is out of with today\u2019s post-colonial norms, but its music has proven timeless.\n",

Sometimes we may show you a series of photos and ask you trivia questions about the photos, other times we play games like \"Reverse Family Feud\" where you'd have to guess the least popular answers to our question (it's soooo much fun!), or sometimes we'll play a \"Find The Common Link\" game where you'll have to answer some questions and figure out the common link between all the answers like this:\nQuestion #1: A Tomato Based Dip\nQuestion #2: A High Stakes Scenario Might Be Described As Make-Or-What?\nQuestions #3: The 2005 Film About Johnny Cash Is \"Walk The _________\"?\nQuestion #4: What German-Austrian Actor's Breakout Role Came In Quentin Tarantino's Film Inglourious Basterds?\nAnswers: #1: Salsa #2: Break #3: Line #4: Cristoph Waltz\nYou and your team would have to first answer the questions and then figure out that the common link between the answers is \"Dance\".\n* QUICK NOTE: THERE ARE LIMITED SPOTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS EVENT SO SIGN UP ASAP TO MAKE SURE YOU GET A SPOT *\nWHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THE EVENT:\n\"I love trivia and this was one of the most exciting trivia nights I've ever been to.

While waiting for everyone to show up, the host would do some trivia questions as icebreakers to \"kill time\" until everyone arrived. We noticed something fascinating begin to happen. People got to know each other better and made more connections during the trivia than they did during the actual speed dating rounds! The trivia questions sparked so much conversation that we thought, \"Wow, we should make an entire event like this!\". And that is how our Singles Trivia Night was started!\nTHESE EVENTS WILL LIKELY SELL OUT BY EVENT TIME AND WE HAVE LIMITED SPOTS AVAILABLE AT EACH EVENT SO GRAB YOUR TICKET ASAP!\n",

    "1287337233319": "Ganz Hall at Roosevelt University:\nPlease enter via 425 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60605 in the evenings.\nCreative Team:\nStage Director: Mark Ross Clark\nConductor: Codrut Birsan\nPianist: Neil Mitchell\nAssistant Conductor: Elle Sunmin Lee\nAssistant Stage Director: Ruobin Huang\nStage Manager: Maddie Mathes\nThe Medium\nIn the parlor of Baba, known to her clients (or victims) as Madame Flora, Monica and Toby play pretend. Monica is Baba\u2019s daughter, and Toby, a mute boy taken in by Baba from the streets of Budapest, is obviously smitten with Monica. Monica, quite aware of Toby\u2019s affections, leads him on, then chastises him; they are not yet ready for tonight\u2019s s\u00e9ance. Baba arrives and they prepare for the charade: they will swindle grieving parents by pretending to communicate with their dead children. First, Monica impersonates the daughter of Mrs. Nolan, a new attendee; then, she and Toby collaborate to imitate the Gobineaus\u2019 boy Mickey, who drowned before he learned to speak.For CSO\u2019s production, The Medium is re-set in Paris in 1939, just before the Nazi occupation. The looming threat of war has left the city steeped in anxiety, with many fearing persecution if the Nazis succeed in invading France (as they ultimately do in June 1940). Among those most at risk are the Romani people\u2014referred to historically as \u201cgypsies\u201d\u2014who, in this production, are represented by the opera\u2019s central characters: Baba, her daughter Monica, and Toby, the mute street urchin she has taken in. Their marginalized status underscores their desperate need for survival, and casts a darker shadow over the emotional and psychological unraveling that follows.\nAll is going according to plan until Baba herself feels a \u201ccold, cold hand\u201d on her throat and abruptly ends the s\u00e9ance over her clients\u2019 objections. Terrified by the possibility that she has somehow meddled with the supernatural, Baba blames Toby\u2014according to her, there is \u201csomething uncanny about him.\u201d Monica tries to calm her by singing the (not particularly calming) \u201cBlack Swan,\u201d but ghostly voices\u2014and latent guilt\u2014convince Baba that she must put an end to the Madame Flora scam.As the next few days pass, tensions rise as Toby\u2019s silence continues to impact both women. Monica blurs the lines between fact and fiction, imagining what Toby might say to her if he could (with little regard for his own feelings). Baba oscillates between bribery and abuse as she frantically seeks reassurance from Toby that her encounter wasn\u2019t truly supernatural. The ensuing silence is more than she can bear, leading to a dark and chaotic series of events. As the curtain draws to a close, she will never get an answer to her final haunting question.\nThe Medium, inspired by a s\u00e9ance attended by Gian Carlo Menotti, is notable for its short length, expertly wound tension, and verismo style that blurs the lines between opera and musical theater. First performed in 1946, it is also one of the rare operas with a film version (directed by Menotti, who not only composed the music but also wrote the libretto).\nGianni Schicchi\nIt\u2019s a classic inheritance tale, set in Florence\u2014though for CSO\u2019s production, it is re-imagined in 1944, just after the city has been liberated by Allied forces near the end of World War II. At this time, Florence is caught between devastation and hope: the economy is in shambles, most of the city\u2019s bridges have been destroyed (except for the iconic Ponte Vecchio), and there is still much rebuilding to be done. But there is also a sense of profound relief\u2014its great artistic treasures, including Michelangelo\u2019s David, have survived the bombings. In this climate of cautious optimism, we find both desperation and opportunism bubbling just beneath the surface.\nAfter the wealthy Buoso Donati dies, his relatives \u2013 cousins Zita and Simone, Zita\u2019s nephew Rinuccio, and a poor brother-in-law, Betto \u2013 make a show of mourning, but instead want to know how much they stand to gain. However, it is soon discovered that Buoso left all his money to a monastery.\nRinuccio suggests that they turn to Gianni Schicchi, a poor man with a reputation for cleverness, to try and change the will. Conveniently, Rinuccio is in love with Schicchi\u2019s daughter Lauretta. However, Zita, who previously agreed to the marriage in hopes of a large inheritance, now backtracks, forbidding her son from marrying the lower-class girl. Despite these objections, the desperate family agrees to consult Schicchi.\nInitially, Schicchi wants nothing to do with this mess, but after Lauretta pleads with him to let her marry Rinuccio, he agrees to help, developing an ingenious plan. Schicchi is even more clever than the family gives him credit for \u2013 and, since forging a will has a steep punishment in this life and the next, he might as well make it worth his while.\nPuccini\u2019s one-act opera, a fast-paced comedic departure from his overall tragic oeuvre, is beloved for the famous \u201cO mio babbino caro\u201d, an aria synonymous with opera itself in the popular imagination. The opera\u2019s lighthearted tone contrasts with the source material; Gianni Schicchi, a real historical figure, is condemned to hell by Dante in his Inferno for impersonation and fraud. In Puccini\u2019s version, though, it\u2019s all worth it because the two young lovers benefit, the greedy upper class are chastened, and overall, the clever Schicchi triumphs\u2014even if just during his time on earth.\n",

Tours cover not only the fascinating architecture in the neighborhood, but also the history of the Gold Coast/NDA.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIt's raining. Is the event still taking place?\nYes! The Garden Walk will still go on if it's raining.\nWhere can I park?\nDiscounted valet parking will be available from Latin Middle School at 45 W. North Ave [ticket sale location and the start of the walk]. There is limited on-street parking. The walk is accessible by public transportation: go to https://www.transitchicago.com/planatrip/ and enter the Latin Middle School Address of 45 W. North Ave.There are some public parking garages in the area: 1560 N Sandburg Tr; 1221 N State to name a few.\nWhere can we eat?\nThere are many charming restaurants near this area. A few that we can recommend for a casual lunch are: Butch McGuire\u2019s at 20 W Division, The Lodge Tavern at 21 W Division, or Hopsmith Chicago at 18 W Division St For an after-walk dinner or drinks, try the 3rd Coast Cafe at 1260 N Dearborn St., the Claridge House at 1244 N Dearborn St. or Orso\u2019s Italian Restaurant at 1401 N Wells.\nAre photographs allowed?\nMost homeowners are flattered to have their garden photographed.

    "1330864675069": "Murray Bowen defined emotional cutoff as \u201cthe process of separation, isolation, withdrawal, running away, or denying the importance of the parental family.\u201d He added this concept to Bowen Family Systems Theory after observing that it was common for family members to distance from one another and even to stop contact. It is a response to increasing emotional intensity as people encounter the difficulties of resolving their differences. It usually involves seeing the other as the problem, blaming and sometimes labeling them as narcissistic or \u201ctoxic.\u201d For some young adults, cutoff may be seen as the only way to preserve self and gain independence. Parents are seen as the problem and getting away as the solution. Cutoff in one generation begets cutoff in the next, as children who grow up in more intense family emotional climates are likely to replicate the pattern as a way of managing relationship tensions. Over generations, emotional cutoff is costly to individuals and families.\nThis conference will focus on alternatives to emotional cutoff. With knowledge of the emotional process that sparks cutoff and motivation to work on one\u2019s own part in it, cutoffs can be bridged, contact can be re-established, and people can reclaim to a significant extent the emotional connection that has been lost through cutoff. Study of one\u2019s family and moving toward a more objective and systemic view are first steps. With an enlarged perspective, one begins to see cutoff as a product of the family emotional system and to see one\u2019s own part in the reactive family patterns. Described by Bowen: \u201cThe study requires that the researcher begin to gain control over his emotional reactivity to his family\u2026and that he develop the ability to become a more objective observer in his own family.\u201d With this view, possibilities for change open up. It is a well-proven avenue for growth in one\u2019s own maturity.\nThe morning will focus on the concept of emotional cutoff and its relation to the total of Bowen theory. CFC co-founding faculty member Stephanie Ferrera, MSW, will present an overview of family emotional process, followed by case studies from CFC faculty John Bell, M.Div, and Cecilia Guzman, MS, illustrating the creative ways they or their clients have reversed family cutoffs.\nIn the afternoon, we will watch the documentary Everything\u2019s Kosher, a delightful story of how one family reconnected and resolved their differences. Faculty member Lisa Moss, MSW, will interview the film\u2019s director and main character, Adam Fried, on this ongoing effort in his family. It is hoped that our audience will take home a host of creative ideas and a spirit of hopefulness regarding their own families.\n",

Sara leads you in exercises to expand your body physically and energetically through breath and meditation techniques, vocal warm-ups, Noguchi Taiso, Qigong, Daoyin, visual imagery and improvisational scores.\nThis workshop lights on ideas of the transformative body and the importance of the lived moment, in order to experience some essential concepts in Butoh. Experimenting with distortion in timing, the uncanny, and the grotesque, we explore how presence and space can be activated on different temporalities. Applying these techniques can expand the vocabulary of embodied movement. This workshop encourages participants to find beauty in the horror of the grimace, to transform ourselves from one state to another, and move from deeply internal impulses to find more unique expressions in our outer movements.\u00a0We will work with forms, images, and butoh fu from the lineage of Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno and students and descendants of these Butoh traditions.\nThere will be time for reflection using automatic writing and/or drawing exercises and short improvised showings to more fully integrate ideas into usable material for making strong choreographic and performance decisions. This is a supportive environment to start an individual and collective process of investigation through creative movement. We will open and expand our awareness, move with our subtler senses, create and witness our personal body language.\nSara Zalek (@01saratonin) is a transdisciplinary artist, producer, and curator. Rooted in physical investigations of transformation of trauma to resilience, their work is intimate, raw, poetic. Zalek ignites dialog with the public using unexpected encounters; always with unknowns, often with humor, and with an intentional focus on the moment when the self is limitless potential.\nZalek performs often in both live and online situations; The City of Chicago named them an Esteemed Artist in 2022. Elastic Arts Foundation awarded them a Curatorial Grant in 2020 for Hot Mess! A hybrid performance event.They were a Chicago Dancemakers Forum Lab Artist in 2015, a 2017 3Arts Make a Wave Awardee, and Ragdale Foundation Fellow. They have performed and curated performances at the Chicago Cultural Center, High Concept Labs, Elastic Arts, Experimental Sound Studio, Links Hall, Lumpen Radio, dfbrl8r, SITE/less, Urban Guild in Kyoto, Japan, and so many more.\nThrough Butoh Curious, Zalek connects national and international teaching artists with Chicago art makers across genres in the independent and fringe arenas (including dance, butoh, physical theater, experimental and improvisational music).

    "1287327554369": "Ganz Hall at Roosevelt University:\n425 S Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL 60605\nCreative Team:\nStage Director: Marinette Gomez\nConductor: Barnaby Palmer\nPianist: Yihao Zhou\nAssistant Stage Director: Johanna Mergener\nAssistant Conductor: Jordan Brooks\nStage Manager: Gianna Gomez\nIn approximately 81 BC during the Roman Republic, a triumphant Silla returns to Rome after defeating not only enemies abroad, but his political enemy Mario. Celebrated with triumphant music, Silla proclaims himself dictator. This declaration is not welcomed by Silla\u2019s wife Metella nor by his friend Lepido, a tribune and advocate for the people. In the name of patriotism, Metella resolves to use her influence to moderate Silla\u2019s ambitions and behavior.\nHowever, nothing bodes well for Rome. Flavia, Lepido\u2019s wife, is having dreams which portend darkness and danger. Lepido acknowledges her concerns but encourages constancy and faith rather than fear and despair. Meanwhile, the political conflict between Silla and Mario has divided two lovers: Celia supports Silla while Claudio believes him a tyrant. The two ultimately move past this conflict and declare their love for one another, but not before Claudio confronts Silla about his attacks on Roman liberty.\nSilla rules with fury, fosters fear in the populace, and attempts to seduce both Celia and Flavia. Metella takes a strong stand against her husband\u2019s behavior, seemingly echoed by Nature itself as Flavia sees additional dark omens. When Celia and Flavia reject Silla\u2019s advances, he lashes out, arresting Claudio, Flavia, and Lepido and sentencing all three to death. Metella conspires to save their lives but draws the line at aiding an assassination of the dictator, whom she still loves. When a disaster demonstrates Silla\u2019s vulnerability, it is Metella\u2019s heroic intervention that allows his redemption, paving the way for a repentant dictator and the return of Roman liberty.\nA great deal of mystery surrounds the initial writing and performance of Handel\u2019s Silla, but it is most noteworthy for its innovative musical writing, much of which would later be repurposed by Handel for his next opera, Amadigi di Gaula.\n",

    "1246508212619": "Kintsugi for Beginners 3:30-5:30 pm on Saturday, 7/19\nKintsugi is a traditional Japanese art form in which gold is used to repair broken ceramics. The practice of Kintsugi highlights the break rather than erasing it and emphasizes that the break, or trauma, is what makes the ceramics more valuable.\nHere is a quote about Kintsugi from Linda Muller, a certified life coach:\n\u201cKintsugi is based on the philosophy that breakage and repair are something to celebrate \u2013 embracing flaws and imperfections creates a stronger and more beautiful piece of art. Using this as a metaphor for healing ourselves teaches us an important lesson: Sometimes in the process of repairing what feels broken, we become moreunique, beautiful and resilient. Kintsugi can be a way to reframe personal challenges. Reminding us that we\u2019re not a victim of our circumstances. Showing us that we can come out on the other side stronger.\u201d\nIn this beginner\u2019s workshop, participants will learn the basic technique of Kintsugi on a small porcelain plate or a small ceramic plate to understand the fundamentals of this process. All materials including adhesives in the workshop will be food-safe. We will also use an artificial Urushi (the natural resin/glue collected from the lacquer tree) sap for this beginner\u2019s class, which is safe to touch without allergy reactions.\nIn the \u201cKintsugi for Beginners\u201d workshop, epoxy putty will be used in addition to the ceramic glue. These materials may make the students\u2019 fingers sticky, and some remnants of epoxy might also stay on their fingers for a few days. There will be finger covers for students to use, but often, that makes working with these materials a bit difficult.\nPlease note that this class has a minimum of 4 participants. If the minimum is not met, students will be transferred to the next offered class.\nAbout the instructor:\nMami Takahashi is a Japanese multidisciplinary artist and a scholar working at multiple citiesincluding Portland, Chicago and Tokyo. She received her MFA in Contemporary Studio Practice from Portland State University in 2013 and earned a BFA in Japanese Painting from Joshibi University of Art and Design in Japan. For more details, visit https://mamitakahashi.art/\nWith ongoing artistic research, practice, and teaching, Takahashi explores different approaches to actualize Japanese aesthetics to enhance cultural perspectives to many U.S. communities. At JAF, she is expanding her creativity to incorporate more specific discourses around society, past and present via a lens of Japanese art. Takahashi also aims to connect between Japan and communities in Chicago by teaching traditional and modern art-making techniques.\n",

About 75 miles and camp at the national park.\nDay 2 we roll out around noon and slow roll our way about 45 miles up to Weko Beach Campground in Bridgman, MI.\nDay 3 is a chill day. Relax on the beach all day or ride into town for some beers or hop on the 25ish mile loop that an OOFD will be leading. Or even go adventure off on your own through the gorgeous country roads of Michigan beer and wine country. So much good beer, food, wine, and beach to explore. The campground is a 4 minute walk to a stellar beach and the epic dunes of Warren are just a few minute walk down the beach.\nDay 4 we ride about 40 miles up to Van Buren State Park which is just south of Grand Haven, MI.\nDay 5 we ride about 60 miles to South Bend, IN and hop the South Shore Train back to the city. A UHaul will transport bikes back to Chicago as the South Bend stop cannot take bikes this year due to track construction.\nSupport: Sag van that will carry one school sized backpack per rider\nLodging:\nThursday - Dunewood Campground - Indiana Dunes, IN\nFriday/Saturday - Weko Beach Campground - Bridgeman, MI\nSunday - Van Buren State Park - Van Buren, MI\nPace: 12-15mph\nTrail/Route: Paved road with minimal gravel incorporated and possible snow.\nAge: Mainly an adult ride (21+) though we are piloting a new concept with this ride (and the Adult Sandy Shores ride) this year. If a parent or guardian has a young person (14+ years old) that may be looking for a bigger challenge beyond our family overnight rides, they are welcome to ride with us on this ride. Their parent or guardian must ride along with them. Its important to understand that this is a ride geared towards adults and there will be maybe only one or two people on the ride that are younger than 21 years old. It would be ideal if the adult has ridden on one of our adult overnights beforehand so they have an idea of what our rides are like. And since this is a new idea we are piloting, we will look for your feedback after the event.\nWhat's Included: 4 nights/5 days of bike camping (It is possible to join us a day late and leave a day early if needed)\nThis ride is an ecstatic celebration of Lake Michigan and all that it coast has to offer. This is going down in the heart of the summer and there will be plenty of chances to go swimming in our gem of a lake. Hence the name, the SWMI, \"swimmy\", ride. Roll with some of the best guides OOFD has to offer as we finally break into our 4th state, Michigan! Learn about the ecology of the lake and the lake shore while also exploring some of its hidden gems and excellent local spots.\nWe understand pulling off a 5 day ride might be tough, so you can join us Thursday night or Friday morning at the IN Dunes. The south shore train is super convenient for this. Also, if you need to dip out on Sunday, the Amtrak and South Shore can get ya back to the city no problem. But the price for the trip is all the same, so you should take advantage of this extended summertime adventure if you can.\nFor a more in depth breakdown of what each day looks like, check this out.\nOur guides are part of a community of volunteers that believe in adventure and helping others find adventure right out our front door. They exude a welcoming, supportive, and inclusive spirit which are foundational values at OOFD. They have love and appreciation for their home and like sharing knowledge about that home with others, thus helping the riders to develop a stronger sense of gratitude for our local history and nature.\nThe guides will be set with the route and an extensive script about the area you\u2019ll be riding through with intentionally chosen breakpoints along the way.\nThey are more than someone to follow on the ride. They are trained and will be there to encourage and support you as well as support with mechanicals that may arise.\nParticipant Cancellation: No Refunds.

We ride rain or shine. Chicago weather is typically passing, if the weather requires, we will pause the ride and wait in a sheltered space then continue biking. Some of the best views of the lake and greenery on the trails are after a rainstorm.\nThis is included in your registration form.

You can see all the dates available there.\nStep into the heart of Chicago's enchanting artist\u2019s colony with this exclusive tour inside the Fine Arts Building. Nestled in the vibrant cultural landscape of downtown Chicago, this architectural gem has stood as a testament to creativity and craftsmanship since its inception in 1898.\nAs you traverse the ornate corridors, walk up and down the grand staircase, and ride some of the last manually operated elevators in the city, you'll be transported back in time to an era when the arts flourished. The Fine Arts Building, originally built in 1893, housed the Studebaker Carriage Company\u2019s showroom and factory.\nThis guided tour will unravel the stories embedded in the building's exquisite architecture, highlighting its role in fostering creativity. Explore the studios that once hosted influential artists, musicians, and writers, immersing yourself in the same spaces that inspired the likes of Frank Lloyd Wright, Lorado Taft, and Sherwood Anderson.\nEvery corner of the Fine Arts Building whispers tales of the creative and enduring spirit of Chicago's artistic heritage. Designed by Solon S. Beman, the architect behind the Pullman Palace Car Company, the building served as a hub for Chicago's burgeoning arts scene in the late 19th century. Now, 125 years later, it continues to play the same pivotal role, preserving the old and perpetuating a new and exciting artistic colony within its historic walls.\nThe tour starts and ends in the Fine Arts Building, 410 S. Michigan Ave., Chicago 60605, Suite 424, the new home and studio of Fab Finds by Doorways Of Chicago!\nSee you at my studio where the tour will start! You are invited to come 15 - 20 minutes early or stay a bit after the tour if you would like to browse my DOC photography collections as well as the FAB FINDS shoppe, which houses a small assortment of fabulous vintage and home furnishings.\nNOTE: This tour is all inside the building (except for a brief step outside to talk about a few of the building's exterior architectural features). Inside there will be a lot of stairs we climb or descend so, unfortunately, this tour is not good for those with accessibility needs. That being said there are elevators in the building that we will sometimes use. They are manually operated elevators (some of the last in the city!) and they can take a long time to come when called for. So we generally use the stairs to keep the tour moving.\nLEGAL NOTICE\nRF Universal Productions, LLC., assumes no responsibility and hereby disclaims any legal or other liability for any personal injury, death, property damage, error or omission, or any other loss, damage, accident, delay, inconvenience, or irregularity occasioned by any individual\u2019s and/or entity\u2019s contemplation of, or participation in, any of the walking tours offered by RF Universal Productions, LLC.

Growing up in Woodlawn and Hyde Park, he worried many a middle school teacher and camp counselor by eating things that he'd found on the lawn, and by teaching his friends about them. After 11 years of teaching in the northern town of Ashland, WI, during which time he led over a hundred foraging walks as well as workshops on a variety of other subjects, he's back in Chicago, and thrilled to explore the wild edibles of his hometown --- and to teach folks about them.\n",

    "1458966501079": "Meditation Circle for Restoration and Reconnection\nIn this practice of yoga nidra, also known as \u201cyogic sleep,\u201d you will be invited to build a healthier relationship with your thoughts, feelings, and body. Yoga nidra is a meditative practice that engages our innate capacity for non-judgmental awareness, and from this place of awareness, we experience a deeper sense of relaxation and inner-wellbeing. Before a 40-minute guided meditation, Naomi will offer an introduction to yoga nidra as well as guidance on how to prepare for a meaningful practice. Throughout the session, you will be invited to hone mindfulness skills and self-compassion with the ultimate goal of generating a sense of peace and healing in your daily life.\nExperiences during this class can range. While some may feel deeply self-attuned and present, others will experience a sense of sleepiness and relaxation. It is also common to feel distracted and even experience frustration or restlessness during meditation. Meditation often brings up a lot of emotions, this is perfectly normal. Instead of allowing our expectations to overcome us, we will learn to meet anything emotional, physical, or mental that arises in the practice with curiosity. You will see over time how your brain, body, and heart will change with the tools of mindfulness.\nFor those who have not regularly practiced yoga nidra or meditation, we offer the reminder that yoga nidra\u2013like all other yogic exercises and therapeutic routines\u2013 requires time and effort to cultivate a sense of ease in sinking into the practice. We are honored to be a guide on your journey of mind-body healing and encourage regular engagement in class in order to experience the full benefits of this practice.

Her focus is  centered around Indigo Sessions, a space for Black women and Queer Folks to tell their stories and share their creations. @indigoesblues Maya Jeanne is presently falling back in love with writing again after so many years of forcing herself to fit into the false narrative that in order to be a successful writer you must also be able to make money from it. Labeling herself as an ever-evolving creative and lifelong learner, she was raised to believe in the innate nobility of all humankind, and strives to live up to the standard that the work we do in this life should be performed in the spirit of service to all mankind. Falling in love with the written word at a young age, Maya has continued to weave that passion into the many avenues she walks. With a BA in Philosophy in her back pocket from North Central College and a life of lived experience, Maya is also excited to begin her career in Behavioral Health. Other than writing, Maya is a nerd of many kinds including but not limited to anything horror, medical dramas, comic book films, and Star Wars. Maya is a proud cat mom, a chronic illness and mental health advocate, a staunch believer that root beer is objectively the best soda. She currently lives in the Chicagoland area. @maya.jeanneKatana Smith is a poet and writer. Her work has appeared in The Paris Review, Tupelo Quarterly, AGNI, and elsewhere. She earned her MFA in Creative Writing and MA in English from the Litowitz graduate program at Northwestern University. She serves as an associate editor at RHINO Poetry and as a reader for Calalloo. In 2024, she was a finalist for the FSG Writer\u2019s Fellowship. Originally from Aurora, Colorado, she now lives in Chicago. @katanaislikeDeKeshia S. Horne is a Black nonbinary (all pronouns) writer from the westside of Chicago that has self-published 5 collections of poetry and been featured in the Austin Weekly Newspaper and Chicago Tribune. They can be called just Keshia or Keko. Currently, they are working as the assistant manager at Barbara\u2019s Bookstore inside Macy\u2019s on State Street and hope to publish soon \u201cIt\u2019s Not A Phase, Ma\u201d, a collection of poems that was written while coping with the grief stages after the death of their mother. @crackedcrownMeghan Malachi is a poet and editor from the South Bronx, New York. She is the first-place winner of the Spoon River Poetry Review 2022 Editor's Prize Contest and a 2022 Pushcart Prize Nominee. She was the runner-up of the 2024 Princemere Poetry Contest and a finalist for the 2024 Hilary Tham Capital Collection and the 2024 Gasher Press Book Award. Her first chapbook, The Autodidact, was published in 2020 by Ethel Zine & Micro Press. She lives in Chicago, Illinois and serves as the Creative Director for Indigo Sessions.
